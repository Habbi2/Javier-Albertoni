The contents of the file /vue-portfolio/vue-portfolio/public/favicon.ico should be a binary file representing the favicon. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon.ico file separately and place it in the specified directory. 

This file is intentionally left blank.
